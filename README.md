# To-Do List App

## Overview
This is a simple **To-Do List App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with **local storage** support. It allows users to add, remove, and store tasks in their browser.

## Features
- **Add tasks** with a text input field.
- **Delete tasks** with a remove button.
- **Persistent storage** using local storage so tasks are saved even after page reload.
- **Minimalist and responsive design** with a clean UI.

## Files Structure
- **index.html** - The main structure of the application.
- **style.css** - Styles the app for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **script.js** - Contains the JavaScript logic for managing tasks and local storage.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field and click the **Add** button.
3. Tasks will be displayed in a list format with a remove button.
4. Click the **X** button to delete a task.
5. Tasks persist in local storage even after refreshing the page.

## How It Works
- The script loads existing tasks from local storage when the page loads.
- When a new task is added, it's saved in local storage and displayed dynamically.
- Clicking the delete button removes the task from both the UI and local storage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality and local storage handling.

## Future Enhancements
- Add task completion functionality (strikethrough completed tasks).
- Implement drag-and-drop for reordering tasks.
- Add due dates and priority levels.
